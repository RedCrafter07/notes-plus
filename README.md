# RedNotes Plus

An SVG-based note taking application

## What is RedNotes Plus?

RedNotes Plus is my take on a modern, simple and intuitive note taking
application for stylus input. It was primarily developed for my use in classes,
but is of course available for any use case imaginable. By default, it uses [Catppuccin
Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) as its color palette. However, custom
themes are planned soon as well.

## What was your motivation?

Apart from being fed up with the fact that most software asks you to pay a subscription,
but also limits its functionality if you don't pay, I wanted to improve the
note-taking experience on Windows. While there is great note-taking software
available, many of the ones I tried were paid for and didn't meet my
expectations. In one way or another. That's why I embarked on a journey to create
a simple, intuitive yet powerful note-taking software.

## Features

- üìÑ Limited and infinite canvas
- üé® Multiple page styles (to be implemented)
- ‚úèÔ∏è Pressure-sensitive stylus input

## Credits

RedNotes Plus wouldn't be possible without...

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), the front-end framework!
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app), the library this software was created with!
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), drastically simplifying CSS!
- [Catppuccin (mocha)](https://catppuccin.com/), the color palette!
- [Vite](https://vite.dev), the bundler for Tailwind and Svelte!
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), the source of the icons used throughout this software!
- Many friends giving me feedback and feature suggestions along the way!

### Use of AI

I have used AI models to help me research what it means to make a user-friendly
note-taking app and to inform me on how to implement some features, like
a pressure-sensitive pen input. I have written all the code myself though!
