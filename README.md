# RedNotes Plus

An SVG note taking application

## What is RedNotes Plus?

RedNotes Plus is my take on a modern, simple and intuitive note taking
application for stylus input. It was primarily developed for my use in classes,
but is of course available for any use case imaginable. By default, it uses [Catppuccin
Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) as its color palette, but custom themes are planned soon as well.

## What was your motivation?

Apart from being fed up with the fact that most software asks you to pay a subscription,
but also limits its functionality if you don't pay, I wanted to improve the
note-taking experience on Windows. While there is great note-taking software
available, many of the ones I tried were paid for and didn't meet my
expectations. In one way or another. That's why I embarked on a journey to create
a simple, intuitive yet powerful note-taking software.
