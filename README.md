# RedNotes Plus

An SVG note taking application for the desktop users

## What is RedNotes Plus?

RedNotes plus is my take on a modern, simple and intuitive note taking
application for stylus input. It was primarily developed for my use in classes,
but is of course available for any use case imaginable.

## Features

Well, it is work in progress now, so unfortunately none yet. I have however
finished a decently working version for drawing, so after implementing the eraser,
there will be actually usable features coming!

## License

RedNotes Plus is licensed under the MIT license. Any credit when using it is
appreciated though!
